# Plant Leaf Disease Classification using a Simplified 11-Layer Deep Neural Network
## 1. Introduction

Plant leaf disease is a major challenge in agriculture and food security, where timely identification and treatment are essential for maintaining crop yield and quality. Traditional disease diagnosis methods are labor-intensive and require expert knowledge, making them unsuitable for large-scale deployment. With the advancement of deep learning, image-based plant disease detection has emerged as an efficient, scalable solution.
In this project, we developed a robust plant disease recognition system using a simplified 11-layer convolutional neural network (CNN). The model is trained on a restructured dataset derived from the publicly available PlantVillage dataset. We reduced the number of classes from 39 to 16 by merging similar diseases across crop types, which significantly improved generalization and reduced model complexity. Our pipeline includes advanced data preprocessing, custom loss functions, and architectural enhancements such as residual connections and attention modules.
## 2. Literature Review

Numerous CNN architectures such as AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet have been applied to plant disease classification tasks. Mohanty et al. (2016) achieved over 99% accuracy using standard CNNs on the PlantVillage dataset. More recently, attention-based models and transfer learning approaches have shown improvements in performance and interpretability.

However, these high-performing models often suffer from overfitting when applied to small or imbalanced datasets. To address this, researchers have explored techniques such as focal loss, label smoothing, data augmentation, and class rebalancing. Our approach draws from these ideas to enhance robustness and performance.

We improve upon previous work by designing a lightweight, custom 11-layer CNN with attention modules, applying focal loss and label smoothing to tackle class imbalance and overconfidence, and simplifying class definitions to focus on core agricultural use cases.
## 3. Models and Methods
### 3.1 Model Architecture

We propose a custom 11-layer CNN that integrates the following design elements:

- **Residual Connections**: Inspired by ResNet, to ease gradient flow and avoid vanishing gradients.
    
- **Attention Modules**: Channel-wise attention (Squeeze-and-Excitation style) applied after major blocks.
    
- **Dropout and BatchNorm**: Applied before fully connected layers for regularization and faster convergence.
    
- **Adaptive Pooling**: Ensures fixed-size output regardless of input resolution.
    

The network has approximately 1.18 million parameters, well-suited for the simplified dataset size (~43K training images).

### 3.2 Loss Functions

We implement two advanced loss functions:

- **Focal Loss**:
    

$$FocalLoss(pt)=−αt(1−pt)γ⋅log⁡(pt)\text{FocalLoss}(p_t) = -\alpha_t (1 - p_t)^\gamma \cdot \log(p_t)$$

Where γ=1.5\gamma = 1.5, αt\alpha_t is the class-specific weight.

- **Label Smoothing Loss**:
    

Smoothed targets:

$$y~i=(1−ε)⋅yi+εK\tilde{y}_i = (1 - \varepsilon) \cdot y_i + \frac{\varepsilon}{K}$$

Loss:

$$Loss=−∑i=1Ky~i⋅log⁡(pi)\text{Loss} = -\sum_{i=1}^{K} \tilde{y}_i \cdot \log(p_i)$$

Both losses help address class imbalance and model overconfidence.

### 3.3 Data Simplification

The original dataset contains 39 classes with high imbalance. We manually grouped similar disease types into 16 plant-specific categories, e.g.,:

- Tomato (healthy, diseased)
    
- Apple (healthy, diseased)
    
- Background, orange disease, etc.
    

This improves training stability and aligns with practical deployment.



## 4. Experimental Setup

### 4.1 Dataset

We used the augmented PlantVillage dataset containing ~54,000 images. After filtering and simplification, the class mapping includes 16 categories, and dataset splits are as follows:

|Split|Samples|Proportion|
|---|---|---|
|Train|43,058|~80%|
|Validation|6,000|~11%|
|Test|4,600|~9%|

### 4.2 Data Preprocessing

- Input resizing to 128×128128 \times 128
    
- Color normalization
    
- Augmentations (train only): rotation, flip, color jitter, random erasing
    

### 4.3 Training Configuration

- **Model**: Custom 11-layer CNN
    
- **Optimizer**: AdamW with $lr=1e−3\text{lr} = 1e-3, weight decay =2×10−4= 2 \times 10^{-4}$
    
- **Scheduler**: StepLR (decay γ=0.7, $\gamma$=0.7 every 5 epochs)
    
- **Batch size**: 64
    
- **Epochs**: 15
    
- **Device**: CUDA (if available)

The model achieves high validation accuracy while maintaining low overfitting due to class simplification and improved regularization.

### 5.2 Comparison

Compared to standard CNN baselines (e.g., VGG11, basic ResNet18 on same data), our model:

- Requires fewer parameters (1.18M vs. 11M+)
    
- Trains faster with less GPU memory
    
- Achieves competitive or better accuracy on the simplified set
