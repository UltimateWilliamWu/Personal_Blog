| A trailer rig was used to analyse the properties of an undamped system and experiment with a range of instrumentation. [1]<br>It was found that two modes of vibration exist, these being longitudinal vibration and rotational. The damping ratio and natural frequency were calculated and are included in this report. The damping was found to be linear. [2] While the experiment was useful it did not closely resemble road conditions. Actual road conditions would result in successive bumps and constant vibration while the wheels rotated the whole time. [3] Finally, it was decided that given cost considerations, the XY plotter provided accurate results and manageable data. [4] | [1] Setup procedure<br><br>[2] Initial findings<br><br>[3]Conclusions<br><br>[4] Recommendations |

| This document compares a range of instrumentation of varying cost and sophistication and investigates the properties of undamped systems. [1] The natural frequency and damping ratio of these systems will give an indication of their behaviour when ‘excited’. Furthermore, an analysis of the mathematical model as compared to actual road conditions must be completed and equipment suggested for further studies of the trailer. [2] | [1] Purpose<br><br>[2] Aim; part of a major report. Requires an outline of the steps you take. |
