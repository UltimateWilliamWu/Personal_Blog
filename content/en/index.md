Hi, Iâ€™m William Wu** ðŸ‘‹

This is my corner of the internetâ€”where I document what Iâ€™m learning, building, and thinking.

Youâ€™ll find:

- ðŸ¤– **AI & Machine Learning**  
    Notes from UNSW/USYD courses (Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, Distributed Systems), plus hands-on experiments in DL/NLP.
    
- ðŸ’¹ **Quant Finance**  
    My _FinMem / Puppy_ project logs: rolling-window forecasting, memory-augmented models, and market analysis.
    
- ðŸŒ± **Course & Side Projects**  
    Plant leaf disease classification, scalable spatio-textual joins in Spark, and various analyses & visualizations.
    
- ðŸŽ® **Life & Interests**  
    Gaming stories, study tools, and small reflections.
    

This blog is both my **knowledge base** and a place to connect. If something resonates, leave a comment or find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/UltimateWilliamWu).
